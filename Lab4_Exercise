We want to reproduce a song (Vader Jacob).

First step: we create the beat/rhythm of the different notes. 
We setup timer0 in order to have a rhythm of around 0.5s.

Second step: We set the DAC.

Third step: We use timer1 as a 16 bit timer.
We desire a 1kHz sine with 16 samples in each period so we set the value for timer1 in order to have a sine at 1kHz.

Fourth step: we use the sample clock interrupt to update the DAC. 
When we reach the end of the look up table we start over again.

Last step: we use timer 0 as the rhythm to go through the buffer containing the tones of the song.
Each time timer 0 interrupt you will update the frequency of the sample clock (timer 1). 
The tone is the index in the LUT in program memory.
