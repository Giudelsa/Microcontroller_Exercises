We implement a counter over SPI.

Our PIC is set as a master and we transmit the counter values over the SPI master.
The received values are displayed on the 8 LEDs on PORTB.

The counter is a simple 8-bit binary counter.
We use RB6 as an enable signal and RB7 to toggle UP/DOWN mode.

Attention: in order to be able to see the LED change we have to set a delay.
