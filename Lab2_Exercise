AD conversion + Signal generation

Connect 8 LEDs on PORTB.

Firstly, we want to read the analog value on RA0 and we show the digital conversion on PORTB.
To create the analog value we use a potentiometer connected to RA0.

Then, we want to generate a signal using a 10KHz PWM: triangular waveform or sawtooth waveform.
